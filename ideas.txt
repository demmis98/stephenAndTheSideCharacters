2 player game

just a bunch of minigames

the old guy at the mall as an npc

attacks?
hosuh's good vives cannon
hosuh's fire starter kit

stephen throwing knives
	reference to ghosts and goblins?
stephen hitting with a gun

references to other animation youtubers on the memory cards
	recreyo

paralax?
	use oem sprites for the borders

3 modes?
	single screen
	double screen
	double looping screen

maybe just select the minigame with on screen arrow buttons

for collisions only store 2 corners

use the 2 most significant bits of a tile for knowing if it is collidable

move with speed rather than just inc the memory adress
